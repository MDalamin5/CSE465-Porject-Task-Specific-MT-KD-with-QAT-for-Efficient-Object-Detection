    "The input images are RGB, so they have 3 channels and are 32x32 pixels.\n",
    "Basically, each image is described by 3 x 32 x 32 = 3072 numbers ranging\n",
    "from 0 to 255. A common practice in neural networks is to normalize the\n",
    "input, which is done for multiple reasons, including avoiding saturation\n",
    "in commonly used activation functions and increasing numerical\n",
    "stability. Our normalization process consists of subtracting the mean\n",
    "and dividing by the standard deviation along each channel. The tensors\n",
    "\\\"mean=\\[0.485, 0.456, 0.406\\]\\\" and \\\"std=\\[0.229, 0.224, 0.225\\]\\\"\n",

    "as well, without recomputing the mean and standard deviation from\n",
    "scratch. This is because the network was trained on features produced by\n",
    "subtracting and dividing the numbers above, and we want to maintain\n",
    "consistency. Furthermore, in real life, we would not be able to compute\n",

    "============================\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to play around with the temperature parameter that controls\n",
    "the softness of the softmax function and the loss coefficients. In\n",
    "neural networks, it is easy to include additional loss functions to the\n",
    "main objectives to achieve goals like better generalization. Let\\'s try\n",
    "including an objective for the student, but now let\\'s focus on their\n",
    "hidden states rather than their output layers. Our goal is to convey\n",
    "information from the teacher\\'s representation to the student by\n",
    "including a naive loss function, whose minimization implies that the\n",
    "flattened vectors that are subsequently passed to the classifiers have\n",
    "become more *similar* as the loss decreases. Of course, the teacher does\n",
    "not update its weights, so the minimization depends only on the\n",
    "student\\'s weights. The rationale behind this method is that we are\n",
    "operating under the assumption that the teacher model has a better\n",
    "internal representation that is unlikely to be achieved by the student\n",
    "without external intervention, therefore we artificially push the\n",
    "student to mimic the internal representation of the teacher. Whether or\n",
    "not this will end up helping the student is not straightforward, though,\n",
    "because pushing the lightweight network to reach this point could be a\n",
    "good thing, assuming that we have found an internal representation that\n",
    "leads to better test accuracy, but it could also be harmful because the\n",
    "networks have different architectures and the student does not have the\n",
    "same learning capacity as the teacher. In other words, there is no\n",
    "reason for these two vectors, the student\\'s and the teacher\\'s to match\n",
    "per component. The student could reach an internal representation that\n",
    "is a permutation of the teacher\\'s and it would be just as efficient.\n",
    "Nonetheless, we can still run a quick experiment to figure out the\n",
    "impact of this method. We will be using the `CosineEmbeddingLoss` which\n",
    "is given by the following formula:\n",

    "have the same number of neurons, equal to the number of classes.\n",
    "However, this is not the case for the layer following our convolutional\n",

    "None of the methods above increases the number of parameters for the\n",
    "network or inference time, so the performance increase comes at the\n",
    "little cost of calculating gradients during training. In ML\n",
    "applications, we mostly care about inference time because training\n",

    "too heavy for deployment, we can apply different ideas, such as\n",

    "tasks, not just classification, and you can experiment with quantities\n",
